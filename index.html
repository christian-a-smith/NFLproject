        <h2>About the Bet Types</h2>
        <p><strong>Moneyline:</strong> A moneyline is simply a bet type that only includes odds, as in “odds to win”. Example: a moneyline of +150, is just +150 odds ($100 to win $150) for the listed team to win. A moneyline of -150 is just -150 odds ($150 to win $100) for the listed team to win.</p>
        <p><strong>Spreads:</strong> The point spread is the expected final score difference between two teams. It is represented as both a negative and positive number; if the spread is 3 points, you'll see that as both -3 and +3. The team that is the favorite to win gets the minus-number (-3); the underdog gets the plus-number (+3).</p>
        <p><strong>Over-Under:</strong> A bet on whether a specific statistic for a game will be higher or lower than a quoted value. This type of bet is also known as a total bet. The most common type of over-under bet is on the combined score of two teams in a match.</p>
